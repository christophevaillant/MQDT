# MQDT
Code for performing multichannel quantum defect (MQDT) theory calculations for 2-electron Rydberg atoms

These are the codes accompanying my thesis and a couple of my publications:
[1] C L Vaillant, M P A Jones and R M Potvliege, J Phys B  47, 155001 (2014)
[2] C L Vaillant, R M Potvliege, M P A Jones, Phys. Rev. A 92, 042705 (2015)

Included are:
-2 and 6 channel MQDT models, which fit experimental energy levels for the optimal MQDT parameters and output channel fractions and magnetic g-factors. See [1].
-Calculations of lifetimes from MQDT parameters. See [1].
-Calculations of C6 long-range interaction coefficients for the heavily spin-mixed 1D2/3D2 states of strontium. See [2]
